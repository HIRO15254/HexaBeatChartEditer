# HexabeatChartEditer

Windows用音楽ゲーム｢Hexabeat｣用の譜面エディターです。

この譜面エディターはMITライセンスのもと公開されている某スライドしてヘドバンする音ゲー用譜面エディタ｢[ched](https://github.com/paralleltree/Ched)｣の改変ツールです

## 機能とか

  * 時間軸ズーム
  * カスタム音符指定(1920分音符まで)
  * 再生プレビュー
  * BPM, ハイスピード, 拍子変更
  * Hexabeat Chart File形式(hxc形式)へのエクスポート

## ダウンロード

現在の最新版は[v1.0.0](https://github.com/paralleltree/Ched/releases)です。

## 使い方

基本的な使い方はChedとほぼ同じです。

自分でWikiを立てるのに時間がかかりそうなので、暫定的にChedさんの[Wiki](https://github.com/paralleltree/Ched/wiki)を参照してください。

(SlideとAir系のノーツがない以外の相違点はほぼありません)
